otf-stix for Debian
-------------------

the STIX fonts offer the promise of much better, more portable support 
for scientific documents on the web and elsewhere. The STIX fonts provide 
a uniform set of fonts that provide the glyphs for almost all the 
mathematical characters that have been added to unicode in recent years.
